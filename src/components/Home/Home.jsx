            The NJV Alumni Council is an initiative aimed at uniting former
            students of NJV School on a single platform where memories,
            experiences, and aspirations converge. It serves as a bridge between
            alumni and their alma mater, fostering a sense of belonging while
            opening avenues for mentorship, professional networking, and community
            service. By connecting generations of graduates, the Council strives
            to preserve NJVâ€™s spirit, celebrate its legacy, and contribute
            meaningfully to the growth and success of its current and future
            students.
